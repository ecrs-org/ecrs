# ECRS - Evolutionary Computation for Rust (working name)

Work in progress...

In future this project will be a Rust crate providing:

* possibly generic implementations of popular evolutionary algorithms (GA, PSO, ACO, FF)
* implementations of various selection / crossover / mutation / replacement operators that might be used in plug-in style in provided algorithm implemenatations
* simple framework to conduct arbitrary evolutionary computation
